ODataViewer
===========


The Open Data Protocol (OData) is a Web protocol for querying and updating data that provides a way to unlock your data and free it from silos that exist in applications today (more).

ODataViewer is an online tool for helping developers query OData URLs and see the results. The tool was built to be pluggable, so developers can develop more and more plugins. Currently, the tool supports the following plugins:

Query auto-completion based on the provided URL.
Displaying the meta-data as an entities-graph (with connections).
Displaying the meta-data as a hierarchical tree.
Displaying the queried data as table (supports associations navigation).
Displaying the queried data as XML.
Displaying the queried data as JSON.
The tool was developed as the graduation project of The Hybrid-Apps development course (Tsofen13) by Tsofen, mentored by E4D And its part of the ODataTools open-source project.
